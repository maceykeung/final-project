  <p class="w3-center">Macey Keung is the Co-Founder of Antifragile Zine.
    <br>
    Antifragile is an artist collective, media platform, and independent magazine created by and for youth artists. We exist online, in-print, and in-person, but above all, we are a community.
    <br>
    Our mission is to highlight and empower the voices of marginalized and underrepresented youth creatives of color and young activists so that they can tell the stories that often get pushed aside and spark radical change.</p>

        "Like many other youth, during 2020’s isolation and quarantine, I felt a lack of connection to others, and a desire to create and speak out about social justice issues going on at the time. I lacked a platform to be able to talk about my experiences, especially as a young woman of color where there are so few spaces for people like me. For much of my life, I felt a huge disconnect to the largely Euro-centered media that exists. 
        <br> <br>
        During that summer of quarantine, my friend Miumi and I decided to take it upon ourselves to launch our own platform, Antifragile Zine, to provide the opportunity for youth artists like ourselves, especially those who have felt unseen in mainstream media, those who identify as LGBT+, women and non-binary people of color, a safe space to connect, grow, and develop our creative aspirations.
        <br> <br>
        Launching less than two years ago in June 2020, we have cultivated a tight-knit community of over 15,000 people from all over the world, working with over 200 artists globally, published 3 print issues, selling over 700 copies of our zines, and hosting local events with over 250 attendees. Running Antifragile has shown me that the need for community among youth and the need for art as a means of radical change is paramount."
